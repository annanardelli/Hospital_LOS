Python program using machine learning, classification, and feature engineering to predict a hospital patientâ€™s length of stay based on datasets containing patient diagnosis information.

This project focused a lot on maximizing accuracy and precision through feature engineering. We conducted many tests using techniques such as One-Hot Encoding, SMOTE, undersampling, and more.

Data set not included because it's too large.
